## Snakerunner

This is a fork of the seemingly discontinued [RunSnakeRun], ported to
Python3.

### Status

Porting to Python3 is finished and it works on MacOS. There are some problems on
Linux due to some gtk3 library issues.

This is a fork from a fairly old project, so the codebase is not very polished
and up to current best practices and standards.


### Requirements

* Python3
* wxpython 4
